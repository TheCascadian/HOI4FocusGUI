# HOI4FocusGUI
Python-based Hearts of Iron IV mod GUI, primarily built for generating random focus trees.

This is, however, a random .exe from the internet. If you're concerned about the potential of issues, please feel free to look for another tool, or reach out if you're interested in assisting with development.

# NORTON AV USERS:
- This will likely be flagged as a virus. I cannot afford to certify this app. If you want to use it still: on the right side of the options for it, there's "Restore", and "Add Exclusion and Restore", click the second option. This should allow you to use the app.
