# HOI4FocusGUI
Python-based Hearts of Iron IV mod GUI, primarily built for generating random focus trees.

This is, however, a random .exe from the internet. If you're concerned about the potential of issues, please feel free to look for another tool, or reach out if you're interested in assisting with development.
